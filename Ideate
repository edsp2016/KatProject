# First step is deciding what region
# Next step is getting GPS/migration data (can use social media?)
# need to find length of stay
# need to find ages - can get from gps? Would NGOs have info about this?
# what problem is this solving? Not enough flexibility in providing services to highly migrant refugees
# assumes that refugees take new routes and stay in paths with fewer resources
# assumes that resources are flexible and can make use of dynamic migratory information
# (secondary analysis) if can find pools of gps for refugees and ages, then figure out what resources are available
